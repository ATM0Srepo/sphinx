# sphinx-ue4
A speech recognition plugin for Unreal Engine 4. 
This is essentially a port of the functionality of Pocketsphinx.

<b>Note:</b> 
This plugin uses a slightly modified version of PocketSphinx, to support passing in a set of keywords, dynamically, rather than a static file of the keywords.

# How to use
I have included a demo asset within the content folder, to showcase an example of its usage.

I would love any feedback/advice on the plugin.
Feel free to fork the code, or to contact me at shane.colbert@gmail.com
