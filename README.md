# sphinx-ue4
A speech recognition plugin for Unreal Engine 4. This is essentially a port of the functionality of Pocketsphinx
When the plugin is activated, a speech recogntion actor becomes available, which can be added to projects.
I have included a demo asset within the content folder, to showcase an example of its usage.
