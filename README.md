# sphinx-ue4
A speech recognition plugin for Unreal Engine 4. 
This is essentially a port of the functionality of Pocketsphinx.
When the plugin is activated, a speech recogntion actor becomes available, which can be added to projects.
I have included a demo asset within the content folder, to showcase an example of its usage.

I would love any feedback/advice on the plugin.
Feel free to either branch and change the code, or to contact me on my e-mail address (shane.colbert@gmail.com)
